            <p>
                <strong> Variables</strong> are containers that you can store values in. You start by declaring a variable with the
                <code>var</code> keyword, followed by any name you want to call it:
            </p>

            <pre class="prettyprint">var myVariable;</pre>
            <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">

                Note: A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends; it is only absolutely required when you need to
                separate statements on a single line. However, some people believe that it is a good practice to put them
                in at the end of each statement. There are other rules for when you should and shouldn't use
            </div>

            <p>After declaring a variable, you can give it a value:</p>

            <pre class="prettyprint ">myVariable = 'Bob';</pre>

            <p>You can do both these operations on the same line if you wish:</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">var myVariable = 'Bob';</pre>

            <p>You can retrieve the value by just calling the variable by name:</p>

            <pre class="prettyprint">myVariable;</pre>

            <p>After giving a variable a value, you can later choose to change it:</p>

            <pre class="prettyprint">var myVariable = 'Bob';
myVariable = 'Steve';</pre>

            <p>Note that variables may hold values that have different data types:</p>

                So why do we need variables? Well, variables are needed to do anything interesting in programming. If values couldn't change,
                then you couldn't do anything dynamic, like personalize a greeting message or change the image displayed
                in an image gallery.
