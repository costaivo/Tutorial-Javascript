        <h1>JavaScript - Loops</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>
            Loops are an incredibly useful programming tool. Loops handle repetitive tasks extremely well, especially in the context
            of consecutive elements. Arrays immediately spring too mind here, since array elements are numbered consecutively.
            It would be quite intuitive (and equally practical), for instance, to write a loop that added 1 to each element
            within an array. Don't worry if this doesn't make a lot of sense now, it will, after you finish reading the tutorial.
        </p>
        <p>
            The two most common types of loops are
            <strong>for</strong> and
            <strong>while</strong> loops:
        </p>
        <h3> for loop </h3>

        <p>A for loop constitutes a statement which consists of three expressions, enclosed in parentheses and separated by
            semicolons, followed by a block of statements executed in the loop.</p>
        <p>This definition may, at first, sound confusing. Indeed, it is hard to understand for loops without seeing them in
            action.
        </p>
        <p> A
            <h4>Syntax </h4>
            <pre class="prettyprint">
       for (initial-expression; condition; increment-expression)  { 
           statements 
        } 
       </pre>
            <p>The
                <strong>initial-expression</strong> is a statement or variable declaration. It is typically used to initialize a
                counter variable. This expression may optionally declare new variables with the var keyword.
            </p>

            <p>The
                <strong>condition</strong> is evaluated on each pass through the loop. If this
                <strong>condition</strong> evaluates to true, the statements in statements are performed. When the
                <strong>condition</strong> evaluates to false, the execution of the for loop stops. This conditional test is optional.
                If omitted, the condition always evaluates to true.</p>

            <p>The
                <strong>increment-expression</strong> is generally used to update or increment the counter variable. The statements
                constitute a block of statements that are executed as long as condition evaluates to true. This can be a
                single statement or multiple statements. Although not required, it is good practice to indent these statements
                from the beginning of the for statement to make your code more readable.</p>
            <p>
                Check out the following for statement. It starts by declaring the variable i and initializing it to zero. It checks whether
                i is less than nine, performs the two successive statements, and increments i by one after each pass through
                the loop: var n = 0;</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">
    var n = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i< 3; i++) {
             n +=i ; alert( "The value of n is now " + n); 
    } 
    </pre>

            <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
      var n = 0;
      for (var i = 0; i< 3; i++) {
        n +=i ; alert( "The value of n is now " + n); 
   } 
      &lt;/script&gt;

   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;    </pre>

            <h3>while Loops</h3>
            <p> The while loop, although most people would not recognize it as such, is for's twin. The two can fill in for one
                another - using either one is only a matter of convenience or preference according to context. while creates
                a loop that evaluates an expression, and if it is true, executes a block of statements. The loop then repeats,
                as long as the specified condition is true.</p>


            <h4>Syntax </h4>
            <pre class="prettyprint">
         while (condition){ 
             statements
        } 
        </pre>
            <p>
                <strong>condition</strong> is evaluated before each pass through the loop.
                <p> If this condition evaluates to
                    <strong>true</strong>, the statements in the succeeding block are performed. </p>
                <p>When condition evaluates to
                    <strong>false</strong>, execution continues with the statement following statements.</p>

                statements is a block of statements that are executed as long as the condition evaluates to true. Although not required,
                it is good practice to indent these statements from the beginning of the statement.

            </p>
            <p></p> The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three.
            <pre class="prettyprint"> 
          var n = 0; var x = 0;
          while(n< 3) {
               n++; x +=n ; 
               alert( "The value of n is " + n + ". The value of x is " + x); 
        } 
           </pre>

            <pre class="prettyprint">

      &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
      var n = 0; var x = 0;
      while(n< 3) {
           n++; x +=n ; 
           alert( "The value of n is " + n + ". The value of x is " + x); 
    } 
      &lt;/script&gt;
